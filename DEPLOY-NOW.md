## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Keep your `WHOP_API_KEY` secret - never share it publicly
- The `.env.development.local` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be pushed to GitHub
- You'll need to add the environment variables manually in Vercel
- After deployment, it may take a minute for changes to propagate

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**App not loading?**
- Make sure all paths in Hosting section are set correctly
- Verify environment variables are set in Vercel
- Check that Base URL matches your Vercel deployment URL exactly

**Build failing?**
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set
